--How to use the program--
The ChatApp has a very user-friendly interface and is self-explanitory. 

1. Bring up 2 or more chat windows, and enter usernames in the textfields provided.
2. Begin typing in the text area and press ENTER to send messages between each conversation window.
3. To send a private message, type in the NAME of the user that you want to send the message privately to, click the private button and the direct next message
   will be sent to only that user

   EXAMPLE: 
   OPEN CHATS: A, B, C
   CHAT A SENDS PRIVATELY TO CHAT B.
   CHAT B RECIEVES THE MESSAGE, but CHAT C does not.

4. Click the 'LEAVE' button to exit the conversation. The panel that you chose to leave will close down, and all other participants of the conversation
   will be informed that the user has left.

   EXAMPLE:
   OPEN CHATS: A, B, C
   CLOSE: B
   B will cose down, then A and C will be notified that "B has left."

ALL OF THE ABOVE IS NOT POSSIBLE UNTIL YOU ENTER A USERNAME. Fields will not be set to editable until a username has been entered.
